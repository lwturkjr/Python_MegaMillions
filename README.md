# MegaMillions quickpick and frequency analyzer
This script aims to analyze the frequency of MegaMillions numbers appearing and generate quick picks using pseudo-random number generation
## Getting Started
Download script, install requirements using pip, I think the only one that isn't standard instal with python is pandas, however they are all listed in the requirements.txt
### Prerequisites
python 3 (tested with Python 3.10.5)
pandas python lib (pip install pandas)
### Additional info
This is a modified version of my Powerball script in honor of MegaMillions getting to 1.1B jackpot. Eventually I would like to add "Hot" and "Cold" picks. Basically numbers that seem to appear more frequently than others, and ones that don't seem to appear as often, also ones that are seemingly "overdue" to be picked given the number picking is completely random all numbers should in theory have the same odds of being picked. (1 in 70 for the white balls, and 1 in 25 for the Megaball) in any given order. If I ever get to implementing that I will add it to the Powerball script as well. Feel free to add it yourself as well of course.
